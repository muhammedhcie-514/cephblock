In this exercise, rbd1 created in section 5.2 will be expanded to 5 GB.
Step 1 Expand the capacity of rbd1 to 5 GB.
Run the following command to expand the capacity of rbd1 from 3 GB to 5 GB:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd --pool block resize rbd1 --size 5G
Check whether the RBD capacity has been expanded:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd --pool block du rbd1

Step 2 Expand the client capacity.
The RBD capacity expansion cannot take effect directly on the client. You need to expand
the partition capacity on the client to complete the capacity expansion. The details are as
follows:
[root@client ~]# xfs_growfs /dev/rbd0


Check whether the partition capacity has been expanded:

df -h
