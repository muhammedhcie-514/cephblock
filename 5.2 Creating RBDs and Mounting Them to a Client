In this exercise, you will create an RBD resource pool named block, and two RBDs, rbd1
and rbd2. The capacities of rbd1 and rbd2 are 3 GB and 5 GB, respectively, and they are
mounted to the /mnt/rbd1 and /mnt/rbd2 directories on the client host.

Step 1 Create an RBD resource pool.
Run the following commands to create a resource pool block and set it to rbd:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool create block
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool application enable block rbd


Step 2 Create RBDs.
Run the following commands to create two RBDs with capacities of 3 GB and 5 GB:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd create --size 3G block/rbd1
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd create --size 5G block/rbd2
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd info /block/rdb1


Step 3 Create a user.
Create the block user and grant the read and write permissions on all RBDs to it.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph auth add client.block mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=block'

command:
ceph auth get client.block

Export the keyring file of the block user as ceph.client.block.keyring.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph auth get client.block -o ceph.client.block.keyring
Send the file to the /etc/ceph directory on the client.

scp ceph.client.block.keyring root@192.168.0.24:/etc/ceph/

Step 4 Mount the RBDs to the client.
Install the Ceph client software on the client.
[root@client ~]# yum install -y ceph
Run the rbd commands to map the created RBDs to the client.
[root@client ~]# rbd map block/rbd1 --name client.block
[root@client ~]# rbd map block/rbd2 --name client.block


After the mapping is complete, check whether the corresponding devices can be viewed.

lsblk


Format and mount the mapped devices to the specified directory as follows:
[root@client ~]# mkdir -p /mnt/rbd{1,2}
[root@client ~]# mkfs.xfs /dev/rbd0
[root@client ~]# mkfs.xfs /dev/rbd1
[root@client ~]# mount /dev/rbd0 /mnt/rbd1
[root@client ~]# mount /dev/rbd1 /mnt/rbd2


Once mounted, the directory information is as follows:

df -h

Step 5 Set the RBDs to be automatically mounted.
Add the following content to the /etc/fstab file:

/dev/rbd/block/rbd1 /mnt/rbd1 xfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
/dev/rbd/block/rbd2 /mnt/rbd2 xfs defaults,_netdev 0 0

Add the following content to the /etc/ceph/rbdmap file:
block/rbd1 id=block,keyring=/etc/ceph/ceph.client.block.keyring
block/rbd2 id=block,keyring=/etc/ceph/ceph.client.block.keyring


Set the rbdmap service to automatically start upon system startup.
systemctl enable rdbmap

Restart the client and check whether the client automatically mounts the two RBDs upon
startup.
If the mounting fails, check whether the RBDs have the exclusive lock. If so, delete it and
mount them again.

rbd lock list block/rbd2
