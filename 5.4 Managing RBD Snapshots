In this exercise, you will create snapshot snap1 for rbd2, create a new RBD based on
snap1, and name the RBD rbd3.
Step 1 Make preparations.
Create a test file named test in /mnt/rbd2 on the client and enter "this is a test file". The
detailed operations are as follows:

Step 2 Create a snapshot.
Create snapshot snap1 for rbd2.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd snap create block/rbd2@snap1

Step 3 Test the snapshot function.
Delete the file test from /mnt/rbd2, roll back the snapshot, and check whether test can
be restored.
Delete test on the client and cancel the mapping and mounting of the RBD. The detailed
operations are as follows:
[root@client ~]# umount /mnt/rbd2
[root@client ~]# rbdmap unmap block/rbd2

Run the following command on the Ceph management node to roll back the snapshot:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd snap rollback block/rbd2@snap1

Map and mount the RBD on the client again and check whether the test file exists.

rbdmap map block/rbd2 --name client.block

ls /mnt/rbdz



Step 4 Create a clone volume using the snapshot.
Set the snapshot to the protection mode.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd snap protect block/rbd2@snap1
Create the clone volume rbd3 for snap1.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd clone block/rbd2@snap1 block/rbd3

Convert the clone volume to an independent RBD.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# rbd flatten block/rbd3

On the client, map the converted rbd3 to the client.
[root@client ~]# rbd map block/rbd3 --name client.block
Unmount the base volume of the clone volume and mount the clone volume to the
/mnt/rbd3 directory.
[root@client ~]# umount /mnt/rbd2
[root@client ~]# mkidr /mnt/rbd3
[root@client ~]# mount /dev/rbd2 /mnt/rbd3

After the mounting is complete, check whether the test file exists.

lsblk


⚫ Question: Is it mandatory to unmount the base volume? And Why?
⚫ Answer: This is a mandatory operation in this exercise because the base volume is
formatted to the XFS format and its UUID is the same as that of the clone volume.
When the clone volume is being mounted, the system considers the clone volume
has been mounted and will report an error. For other file systems, you do not need
to unmount the base volume.
